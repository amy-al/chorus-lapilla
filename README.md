# Chorus Lapilli

A modified tic-tac-toe game! (My first React project!)

This project is from the course CS35L with Professor Paul Eggert taken in Fall 2022 at UCLA. It builds on top of the Intro to React Tutorial for tic-tac-toe. Chorus Lapilli differs from tic-tac-toe in that after each player has placed three pieces onto the board, they can no longer place more and have to move existing pieces into empty squares until one player wins.
